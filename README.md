# So you want to work at Mindgrub?
Welcome to Mindgrub's open casting call for [Software Engineers](https://www.mindgrub.com/careers).  Just like a casting call for performers, Mindgrub holds open casting calls year round to fill our ever increasing list of open talent positions.  If you've got talent, we're ready to be amazed!

# Here's how it works
* Our git repository holds a base starting point.  Think of it as your blank stage.
* Fork our git repository and build something amazing in one (or a combination) of the technologies we use on a daily basis:
  * Objective-C
  * Swift
  * Java (Android)
* Once you've got something cool, open a Pull Request back to us so we can see your awesome work.  The best Pull Requests will be invited to our offices to show off your work in person, quiz our engineers about how to improve your work, and interact with our Holodeck and Robots.

# Prizes
* As mentioned above, the best will be invited to the Mindgrub offices to demo your work in person, quiz our engineers about how to improve your work, and play with our robots.
* The best of the best will be given bragging rights and the opportunity to work with some of Baltimore's best engineers at one of the coolest offices on the East Coast (who else has a Holodeck, Climbing Wall, and robots in their office?).  These are the same engineers that have built world-class experiences for Under Armour, Discovery Kids, University of Maryland, The Economist, The Smithsonian Institute, [and more](https://www.mindgrub.com/work).
